If you encounter a bug, please submit an issue.

If you want to contribute to the code,
first ask to the team where to begin.

When making a contribution, please name your branch with the issue's id.

For example, on the issue nÂ° 23, you could name your branch `23-add-of-a-new-feature` or `23-fix-this-horrible-bug`.

Then you could submit a Merge Request.

The CI is configured, so you could check also if your branch is not breaking anything.
