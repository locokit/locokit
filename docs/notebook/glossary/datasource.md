# Data source

A data source is a connection to a file or server
containing data.

This can be a database, like a PostGreSQL one,
or a file, like a SQLite database too.

We imagine in the future that APIs could be also datasources.

In case of database server,
the datasource is able to separate access to the server with 3 different users :
* read only : users can only read data (eg : public access)
* read & write : users can read and write data (eg : normal users)
* alter : users can alter the schema of the database
