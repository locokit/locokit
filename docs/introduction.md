# Introduction

Welcome on the LocoKit Documentation.

LocoKit mean "Low-Code Kit". We name it also LCK.

LocoKit is a platform 

We want to build a portal that help user build easily a database,
and an app on top of it, without coding too much. "Low code".

This portal is here to explain what is LCK platform,
and how it works under the hood.

## So, what exactly is LCK ?

**Technically**, LCK platform is a NodeJS + FeathersJS + VueJS powered platform.

**Functionnaly**, LCK platform is a web platform allowing users to :
* create database (with tables, related tables, ...), like a mini AirTable app
* grant access to this data, according users permissions (via group)
* visualize data, through a hierarchy of chapter / page / container / block, like a mini CMS
* process data, with a minimum viable orchestrator

What we hear by *"Low-Code"* is the fact that you'll need, sometimes, to write some code,
helping the platform to better understand what you exactly want / need.

For example, that will be necessary
when you'll write formulas for computed columns,
allowing you to compute data "automagically".

Or when automating some processes with the orchestrator.
