# Getting started

To be written.

# Docker images

LocoKit has several docker images :
* amd64
* arm64/v8
* arm/v7
* arm/v6

The `arm` images can be used on Raspberry Pi. We have tested on Model 3B, ARM 32 bits v7.

They can be found on docker hub :
* LocoKit API images : https://hub.docker.com/r/locokit/api
* LocoKit APP images : https://hub.docker.com/r/locokit/app
