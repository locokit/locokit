# LocoKit application

This folder contains the app powering the LocoKit frontend.

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
pnpm install
```

Then copy/paste the `.env.example` in a `.env` file.

This file provide some settings to the frontend application, like the API URL.

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3030
VITE_LOCALSTORAGE_KEY_AUTH_TOKEN=locokit-local-auth-token
VITE_LOCALSTORAGE_KEY_AUTH_USER=locokit-local-auth-user
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=
VITE_SENTRY_ENV=
VITE_STORAGE_URL=
```
