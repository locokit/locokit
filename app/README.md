# Nuxt LocoKit Application

This is the folder to develop the LocoKit Application.

This Nuxt app is based on the `nuxt-locokit` package,
in the `../packages/nuxt-locokit` folder.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies at the repository level (folder above).

We use `npm` as the package manager, please keep using it.

```bash
# npm
npm install
```

To `prepare` the Nuxt app, we have to build first the `nuxt-locokit` package.



## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Check out the [deployment documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for more information.
