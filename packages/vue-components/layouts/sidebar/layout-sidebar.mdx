# Sidebar layout

The sidebar layout allows us to define a sidebar to the left,
dynamically feeded by a `sidebar-nav` slot.

You can define a title with the `sidebar-title` slot. (Use a h3 inside)

The sidebar is retractable / expandable through a dedicated button.

The user button is also available, to show a dedicated menu.

There is a default menu that you can override through the `user-menu` slot.

You can define the main content through the default slot.
