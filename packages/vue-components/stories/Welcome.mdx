# Welcome on LocoKit's storybook

Welcome on the LocoKit's storybook.

You will find here all the **Vue** components we use in our back-office
and front-office applications.

Please discover them through their dedicated stories,
and learn how to use them,
regarding their props or events.

## Getting started

### How to install ?

This package `@locokit/vue-components` is based on:

- TailwindCSS
- PrimeVue components
- `@locokit/locales` and `vue-i18n` to have translations
- `@locokit/definitions` to have commons code
- `primeicons` and `bootstrap-icons` according your needs

This lead to this command

```sh
pnpm add primevue @primevue/themes \ # primevue dependencies
  tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer tailwindcss-primeui \ # tailwind dependencies
  @locokit/locales vue-i18n \ # translation dependencies
  @locokit/definitions \ # other @locokit dependencies
  primeicons bootstrap-icons # icons (bootstrap + prime)
```

## Colors

This components library use PrimeVue + TailwindCSS.

Several semantic colors are available :

- primary (based on the blue of logo)
- secondary (based on the orange of logo)

<div class="bg-primary p-4 m-4 text-2xl flex items-center justify-center text-white">
  Primary color
</div>
<div class="bg-secondary p-4 m-4 text-2xl flex items-center justify-center">Secondary color</div>
