# Data picker

Alternative implementation of a multiple `<select>` offering to the user to
make a selection of items by picking them from a first list of all available
items to a second list representing the selected ones.

This component is inspired by PrimeVue's [PickList](https://primevue.org/picklist/).

Unlike PrimeVue's, this component allows you to manage a dynamic list of items,
but unfortunately it is not as good in Responsive and Accessibility.
